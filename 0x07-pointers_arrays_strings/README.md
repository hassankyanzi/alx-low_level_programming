##0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

### Requirements
Language: C89
OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

### Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for Alx. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

### Concepts to be learned in this repository:
What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings
Description of what each file shows:
a function that fills memory with a constant byte (memset)
a function that copies memory area (memcpy)
a function that locates a character in a string (strchr)
a function that gets the length of a prefix substring (strspn)
a function that searches and returns a pointer to a byte matched in a string (strpbrk)
a function that locates a substring (strstr)
a function that prints the chessboard
a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers
a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char
a file should contain the exact password, no new line, no extra space
